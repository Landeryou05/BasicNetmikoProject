# Basic Netmiko Project

## Description
- This is part of my Project for my System Architecture and Automation module.
- This is a basic network automation project that remotely connects to a local virtual machine (designed for Ubuntu) and enables command line interaction with the VM via hardcoded functions.

## Prerequisites
- Python3 or later installed.

## Dependencies
- This program requires 3 dependencies. These include the netmiko library, public-ip library and the requests library.
- However, you can install these dependencies within your local environment with the following commands:
    - 'pip install public-ip'
    - 'pip install netmiko'
    - 'pip install requests'

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Landeryou05/BasicNetmikoProject.git
```

## Additional Notes
- The public IPv4 address functionality is dependent on your ISP's DHCP functionality - sometimes it works, others it won't.
